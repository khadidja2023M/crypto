# SOLiGence Cryptocurrency Predictive System
SOLiGence is a streamlit app that allows users to purchase cryptocurrencies at lower prices and sell at higher prices for a substantive profit. 
The dataset is from yahoo finance; it's real-world historical data. It has ten coins merged for nearly five years and a half from 01/01/2018 to 07/07/2023 with a 1-day interval.
The main aim of the project is to predict the prices with as much as possible precision so that the investors can have an idea of whether to invest the funds by analysing the future prices.
You can run the App by running main_module.py(streamlit run main_module.py).
