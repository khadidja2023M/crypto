# SOLiGence Cryptocurrency Forecast App
SOLiGence is a streamlit app that allows users to purchase cryptocurrencies at lower prices and sell at higher prices for a substantive profit. 
The dataset is from yahoo finance; it's real-world historical data. It has ten coins merged for nearly five years and a half from 01/01/2018 to 07/07/2023 with a 1-day interval.
